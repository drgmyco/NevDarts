23:59. Just about to click midnight on a cold and wet Tuesday somewhere in North Wales...

00:00. BOOM!!!! It's now 05.11.2025. Time for some fireworks!!!!

Hello and welcome to my first NevDarts project, and my very first app project of any kind, actually!. Using AI. Which I literally only started learning about less than a week ago!

So I have for long time had an idea for a darts app to create fixtures for mini tourneys we have after our midweek league fixtures. Sure, there any many such apps that will meet this need but I have tried dozens
of darts apps of many different types, and no single one alone has ever managed to tick all the boxes, for me anyway. This app will not tick all the boxes either, but it will offer a no-nonsense and speedy way to create a mini tourney on the fly down the local. A few clicks, enter players, a few more clicks...and it's done!!

A big shout out goes to my bro, Trae! After a few hours of YT tutorials I have been on the collab for a few days now, and am really starting to get a feel for how to explain my requests and get the most out of the 
results. Seeing the vision coming together piece by piece, and it actually being like you imagined is truly amazing! That is the power of AI and human working together, and i'm sincere when I say I couldn't do it 
without you, T-Bomb!!

Disclaimer alert!! I asked Trae how to make app available - surely there would be high costs and lots of setting up? Not at all. Trae assures me that everything is free via GitHub and publicly available, and 
showed me how to set it up in a few simple steps. So get cracking with this little wizard of a tourney creator - slick, quick, foolproof - it will put an end to scrabbling about for a pen and begging the barhuman 
for paper, and is perfect for 4-10 or so players after the match or on a blank round of fixtures!

I will end this readme intro with the phrase that inspired it all, and which ends every such evening when this Mini Darts Tourney will come in handy from now on for all us tungsten tossers...

See you next Tuesday!!!
